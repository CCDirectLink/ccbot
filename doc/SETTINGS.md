# Settings

All of these are described individually too.

They can be controlled per-guild by the local ADMINISTRATOR or bot owners.

They can be controlled globally only by bot owners.

## Global

`nsfw-<GUILD ID>`: Boolean, effectively forcefully enables the per-guild `nsfw` setting.
Example: `-util set-boolean nsfw-558469426765103135 true`

## Per-Guild

`nsfw`: All emotes that come from this guild are marked NSFW

`roles-*`: Please see `ROLES.md`

## Both

`prefix`: Part of Commando
`emotes`: See EMOTES.md
`emote-<EMOTE REF>`: See EMOTES.md

(document Commando's enable/disable system at some point)
