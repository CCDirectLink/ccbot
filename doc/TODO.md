# The Grand TODO List

missing commands from general: poll, leaCheeseArmy, purge, box, rbox, setname, sleep, say, emote, lsemotes, react, cheater, cube

other modules status unknown

old behaviors need reimplementing!

countdown isn't there (should be separate entity really)

"failed to load" -> "oof" is done

stream drawing monitor isn't done, but a skeleton's in the old behaviors entity

member enter/leave & roles control is completely not there.

part of this is OldBehaviors territory, part of this should be the roles commands
