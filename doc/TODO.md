# The Grand TODO List

missing commands from general: leaCheeseArmy, say, emote, lsemotes, react, cheater

commands that won't be added in my PR (#9),
 since issue #10 is unsure, doesn't specify, or I'm sleepy: poll, box, rbox, cube, sleep, purge, setname

issue #10 documents various other details

other modules status unknown

old behaviors need reimplementing!

countdown isn't there (should be separate entity really)

"failed to load" -> "oof" is done

stream drawing monitor isn't done, but a skeleton's in the old behaviors entity

member enter/leave stuff isn't there

roles control is sort of there, but no auto-roles

part of this is OldBehaviors territory, part of this should be the roles commands
