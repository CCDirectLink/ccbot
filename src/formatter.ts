/// Runs a line of the bot's format-syntax.
/// Credit for the theory behind the design goes in part to LISP, PHP, and in part to (er, Lanterns, what's the name of your group again?)'s bot '42'.
///
/// Essentially, this is like PHP & 42 in operating principles;
///  without proper encapsulation, text goes to 'standard output'.
/// The return value of the function is the text,
///  which also makes any formatting directive implicitly usable in other ways if the system gets more complex.
///
/// The VM within that, above, is LISP-style (different data structure though).
///
/// The special sequences are:
/// %: Escape character. Will escape anything, except ( outside of a list system.
/// %%: How to write '%'.
/// %(...):
///  Execute custom format insertion. The contents of this are a recursive list.
///  Within this, a separate set of syntax rules are defined.
///  All that really matters here is that %(emote leaCheese) gives you <:leaCheese:257888171772215296>.
///  Any value can be prefixed with ' to wrap it as so: (%' list)
///  Also, " is pretty much a togglable escape.
/// /leaCheese/: Shows the leaCheese emote. For compatibility with old .cc say
/// //: Repeated verbatim, escapes text until next space. Used to keep URLs happy
